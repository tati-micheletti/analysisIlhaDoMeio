################################# ILHA DO MEIO CRAB ######

# CRABS: lesser wave action associated with neap high tides (in first and last quarters of moon cycle)
# are prefered. In the same way, peak periods of rain (i.e., March or April)
# --> Rainy season is covered by JulianDate
# --> Need to add moon phase for crabs
